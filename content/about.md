I'm a computer programmer based in Melbourne, Australia.
My experience is mostly in systems programming: decompilers/reverse-engineering tools, database implementation and low-latency trading systems.

In 2019, I embarked on a journey to get job working on compilers.
You can read more about that experience [here](@/post/compiler-journey.md).

Opinions are my own, etc.
