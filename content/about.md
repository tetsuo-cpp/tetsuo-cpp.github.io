I'm a computer programmer based in Melbourne, Australia.
My experience is mostly in low-level systems programming and I've worked across a number of domains including: decompilers/reverse-engineering tools, database implementation and low-latency trading systems.

I deliberately don't have comments enabled on this blog but if you'd like to chat, feel free to shoot me an email.
I'd love to hear from you!

Opinions are my own, etc.
